rpg-maker-charset-converter
===========================

A command-line for converting RPG Maker charsets from various formats (2000/2003, XP, VX Ace) into other formats (XP,
VX Ace), but it's not currently functional as it's in the middle of a rewrite.

Optionally produces graphics formatted for GTBS.
